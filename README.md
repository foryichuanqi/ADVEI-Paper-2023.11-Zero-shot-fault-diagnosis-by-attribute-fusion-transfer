# Easy to reproduce all details of our paper successfully
The downloaded compressed package can reproduce our method.To make code easy to run successfully, we debug the files carefully. Generally speaking, if environments are satisfied, you can directly run all the xxx.py files inside after decompressing the compressed package without changing any code.

(1) Download and rename xxx.zip to AFT.zip (Rename to avoid errors caused by long directories)

(2) Unzip AFT.zip

(3) Run any xxx.py directly
